Three Machine Learning models have been successfully implemented and compared for a 
training dataset for predictive maintenance analysis of drug manufacturing equipment 
to reduce the downtime of an  equipment. 
The AUC value for XGBoost Classifier is observed to be the highest among 
the three implemented ML models viz., Random Forest, Decision Tree and XGBoost 
Classifier.
